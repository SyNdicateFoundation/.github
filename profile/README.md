Hello Everyone,
We’re making a change to support our mission’s progress: we’ve renamed our organization and will continue development under a new, completely separate GitHub organization.
## What This Means:
- Our current repositories will remain available and continue to work.
- We have created a new GitHub organization that is fully separate from the current one.
- We ask that you update your software, integrations, and workflows to point to the new organization to avoid future confusion and to keep receiving updates.
## Action Required:
- Update repository URLs, package sources, CI/CD configs, webhooks, and automation to the new organization’s paths.
- Replace remote origins in local clones.
- Update any dependency references or container image tags that point to the former organization.
# Note
### Please complete migrations by 2 months from now.
# Thanks for understanding.
